Identifying real-world safety risks requires connecting with the real world â€“ placing your drug life cycle data in the
context of the people and products outside of your organization. With the proliferation of new technologies, varying

disparate data into your drug safety workflows to run accurate signal detection and prioritize case management now
demands not only reliable access to siloed data sources, but confidence in the data itself.
